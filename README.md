# Swift on the Web

This repository shows a few examples

## String-based Swift-JS API's

Demonstrates passing data as a String between Swift and JavaScript.

Builds off of the [example from the SwiftWasm book](http://book.swiftwasm.org/examples/exporting-function.html) that shows passing Integer types.

See [here](./poc-hello-world-interoperable/README.md) for details.
